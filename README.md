## What is Guardian Protocol?

Guardian Protocol is a Liquid Staking solution on Vara Network that allows users to participate in VARA staking while maintaining token liquidity. The protocol issues staked tokens (gVARA) that represent the user's participation in the staking pool.

## Main Features

1. **Liquid Staking**: Participate in VARA staking while maintaining your token liquidity
2. **Staked Tokens**: Receive gVARA as a representation of your pool participation
3. **Decentralized Interface**: Access through a 100% decentralized interface
4. **Vara Network Integration**: Built natively for the VARA network
5. **Security**: Implements best security practices for smart contracts

## Architecture

The project uses a decentralized architecture where:
- The frontend is deployed on NEAR Protocol's Blockchain Operating System (BOS)
- Smart contracts run on Vara Network
- Interfaces are built using Eternacode to ensure decentralization
